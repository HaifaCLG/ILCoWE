In my opinion, the ability to relate well with students and excellent knowledge of the subject are both important for being a good teacher. if you can have the both of them it will make you such a professional teacher and manager for the class.
I also think that both are connected to each other because if the teacher have the ability to relate the students well and to treat them with a good valuse such as respect, care. patient it will help him to teach and give the material in a better way and it well cause a very well or even an excellent knowledge of the subject your teaching. if you give the students that feeling of relef and comforte to ask they well feel free to ask you if they cant understand something or maybe have a difficulties.
A good teacher for me is the one who teaches not only with mind. but also with heart.
However' the excellent knowledge is not less important. we cant be a good and professional teachers without being good in our work. teachers also must be effective and serious and didicate himself in somehow to his work. because teaching is a message that we have to send to our students!
there is a saying. " Give me a fish and I eat for a day. teach me to fish and I eat for a life time". this must be the philosophy of a good teacher.
At the end each and everyone of us aspire to be a professional teacher.so we must know how to mix between the two things that mentioned up. because if we dont mix it in the right way it will have a bad influence on the students. for example if I'm as a teacher focused on the excellent knowledge it well be just teaching the material and go and that will not make us a professional teachers as well.
