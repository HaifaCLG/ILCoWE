As a matter, I am very upset at the way video games use swearing and curse words. My kid spends a lot of time watching and playing video games and he starts to use bad words in his real life. I think he doesnt realize that these words are not appropriate. Moreover, he doesnt know their meaning. I try to react calmly and ignore what he says, but sometime I become yelling or punushing him.
