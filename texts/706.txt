The technology is developing, and most of pepole have cars. so, there always crowded in city center. Actually I hate traffic cars so I with this decision of banning cars from entering the city center.
Firstly, as I said in the previous paragraph that most pepole have cars, they cous air puolition when the gas is released from the cars, and that influences on pepole.
Secendly, too much cars in the city center will affect on pepole and on the earth and on Atmosphere (the ozone layer). this is not good for humans.
Endly, we have to reduce from cars in our life, to make life healthier.
