Recently, many cities have begun banning cars from enterning the city center. I think this is a good idea with many advantages.
On the one hand I want to talk about the advantages of this decesion it will reduce the traffic in the city center and decrease the number of the car accidents in addition this decesion will reduce the pulltion.
On the other hand we have some disadvantages to deal with like, there is many employers whos work in company at the city center will cope with problems while going to work because they can't arrive in the time without using there special cars.
In conclution, although there is some disadvantages I think if they could have an alternative methods for the employers to get to work in the city center I can say that it’s a good idea to implement.
