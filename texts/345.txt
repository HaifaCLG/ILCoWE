Over time we find that the advancement of woman in the tech sector and its development is too low. This is an obvious phenomenon in our era.
Although there are many reasons for this phenomenon, but there are prominent problems in our society in addition to studies which imphasize it.
I am starting explaining my own opinion, going back to high school, most males "men" were prominent in this field than women, although women made too many efforts to lead and succeeded and sparke this field to men, they had full success of being compared to they were not such investors.
I do believe that the main reason for this phenomenon is only society because subconscious knowledge was already been pentrated although it is always possible to change and work on it.
