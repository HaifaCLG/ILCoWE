I enjoyed reading about the 3 articles about the "clean eating" because everyone of us need to be aware about healthy and clean eating cause it is can improve our life. the first article: "why we fell for clean eating?". in this article was talking about person who became "orthorexia" of her wrong "clean eating". the second article: "too clean". the article is talking about how the real diet should be and how diets differ us and it can be harmful sometimes. the last one: "12 clean eating goals you should know". I really like this article because it tell us to eat clean food in our lifestyle. I like the goal of number 4 because we must to eat fruits and vegetables. and in this article we see that we can eat fruits and vegetables in many different ways.
