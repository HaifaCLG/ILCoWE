A filter bubble refers to the results of the algrithms that dictate what we encounter , those algrithms create a unique world of information for each of us , many sites like google facebook ... offer personlized content selections based on our browsing history ,age ,location and other data . the result is articles and posts which support our current prespectives and this is they're way to make sure that we enjoy what we see , in my opinion this is a bad thing because my social circle is a filter bubble , i only follow people thinks like me and have the same opinion and perspectives that i have and forget that other people prespictives exists causing me to become intellectually isolated.
