Many cities have begun banning cars From entering the city center, I think it is a good idea but it might have disadvantages.
On the one hand, this idea has many advantages. First, the center of the city is always crowded by people who go to buy and get their needs. This idea help them to move in the center of the city easily and without being disturbed. secondly, it reduces the air pollution, and prevent cars accidents.
On the other hand, this idea also has disadvantages. For example, there are many people who can't arrive to the city center without a car, they may suffer From diseases that don’t enable them to arrive the center without a cars, and maybe their homes far away.
In conclusion, although it is a good idea it might have disadvantages. It maybe a good idea For some people and maybe negative idea For others. I think it is possitve way that help the people to move In the Center, however the government must intervene in this idea and mabe a Final decision on this matter.
