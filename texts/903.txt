Singel-gender schools have many advantages for their students. Recent studies show solid evidence that students in singel-gender schools are happier, confident and got higher grades than their peers in mixed-schools.
One of the most important factors at school is a child's confident. When a child feels confident at school and with his friends, his academic perform will be better, indeed. At girls-schools, for instance, we can notice that the social pressure is drasticly low. This is because there is no competition between boys and girls. With that in mind, boys tend to be more competitive and bit aggressive.
In addition, each gender has its own learning styles. Girls, for example, learn better in small groups. While boys are more effective in working individually. Furthermore, girls at singel-gender schools are less shy. This underlines the fact that in these schools girls are more open and are willing to take risks.
Personaly, as a teacher in a girls-school, I have to say that it is highly recomended for girls. My school demonstrated the meaning of democracy and high achievements.
