Banning cars from entering the city center might cause a lot of problem But there is "Two sides to every story". So i am completly supporting this choice.
On the one hand, There would be many benefits especially for the store owners if the cars enter the city center. Furthermore, this could make the country economy on the highest Ranks. For example, Cars in the city center means more people would Cross by stores and in that way. the country will benefit.
On the other hand, Disadvantages always exist, Cars cause pollution to the air. But when cars enter the city center, all of the pollution will be focused in the same area and not spreat out. For example. Cars is burn the fuel, and this means they release a Co gas from the exhaust of the car and this gas is hamfull for people.
In conclution, I see that banning cars from entering the city center is the right thing, and might lead to a good step for the future. The health of the nation versus the state investment and economy?
