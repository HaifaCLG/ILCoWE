I want to discribe a nice thing I did For someone. I and my family help my best friend when she was in problem. She was very sick and need many to treat. I started to collect a money and denotion, but it was hard because we don’t have many of money. My father stood by me and suppoted me. I was feel happy because I loved to help anyone and I loved to take hope From Friends and everyone.
