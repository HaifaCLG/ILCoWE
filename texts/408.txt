actually, the 3 articles were interesting, but the most article i did really enjoyed and make me be more passion in how can i get and earn money from the social media apps! this was for me a new idea i didn't know about before, to be hones; is "posting Instagram sponsored content is the new summer job", and it shows the reality indeed, while someone famous can earn a lot of money because he/she has a hundred of followers on Instagram contrast to someone who works in the summer and study at the same time.
