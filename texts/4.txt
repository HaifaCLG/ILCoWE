According to recent researches that has been held about giving homework to pupils after spending all day studying at schools, the results show that is not preferable. I agree with the results/findings. In the supporting points I will say why it is not preferable:
First: pupils invest lots of energy while they are at school. So they go back home exhausted and tired.
Second: I think it is enough for pupils to do / solve one exercise or one worksheet in clase to show that he or she understand the new material tought in class.
Thirdly: I think that giving lots of homework to pupils will only make them feel frustrated and nervous.
Finally and according to the points I explained and menssioned apove I really disagree and refuse totally the idea of giving homework to pupil after schoole.
