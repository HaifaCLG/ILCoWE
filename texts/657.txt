I like to do many things and it is: to draw, to write, to do sport and many things else. I want to visit hollwood because I want to see my best singer beyonce. she is my example. My big and the first goal in my life that I want to achieve is to be a doctor someday. I love to be a doctor because I love to help to the people and to glad them, to give thim hope and to give thim another chance to live. thats my dream. My second goal is to be a Jombaz player because thats my hope, when I feel not good I play Jombaz because it take all my nigtive energy I hope my all dreams will come true.
