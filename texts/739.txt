Onse, My Mom Sayed to me: ”if you make someone happy, you will be happy for that, today I want to share my great experience that I did for someone. I went with a group of youngers to the hospital to make different activities for the cancer patients, Our order was to make them happy and gives them the hope to struggle and beat the cancer. first, We bought a lot of the gifts and brought a deeidus food and sweet for them , after that we made activities such as drewing, singing, ballgames and reading books. To sum up , we sat down at the grass in outside and everyone from us talked about himself: what his beautiful memories what diffuclties that he faced in his life and how to beat it. I enjoyed very much and learned very values about helping others and my mom’s saying is true.
