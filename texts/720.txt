Before to years, I went with my family to the south of Israel, it was a jeeps trip, at first i enjoyed this journey, but we went mountains there was a big hole of water, i don't know how to swim but my family encourged me to jumb to the hole, it was the dumpest thing that i did, i jumped to the hole the death was nearby i thought it the last seconds in my life but my friend Basil saved me i was scared from that and won't back to water again or forgot what he did. he saved my life and i wish to do the same thing to him.
