No one forgets a good teacher.
No one forgets a good teacher, it’s a strong title,.. when you read it when you say it, you will feel that.. because we really can not for get our specific teacher , that gave us a good quality , a good teaching and a good memories.
you will not ever forget the person that how gave you the first book to read it in your life, you will not forget the human that he told to you how to spend your time perfectly besides tour books besides your ideas besides your mine and your words, how you can forget the human that he said to you in some time when you failed in your lesson "hey you stand up and be strong dare to dare to dare to try to achieve and to get your grads again stand firm " you will not ever "ever" forget that person that he walked the whole way with you, what I mean in the whole way "the specific and the first steps for you in any level in your studding"
a good teacher how gave you a chance in the life to walk in the solder road step by step to get your goals without stress.
