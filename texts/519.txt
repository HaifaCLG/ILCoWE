The promote state that the young people have fun more than the older people ,The definition of enjoyment is diffrent from every individsual ,I dissagree with the argument because i beilive there are many reasons where we can find older peopel enjoy life to the hilt rather than the younger ones. some people enjoy sitting alone and listening to music,others may enjoy reading books. in these days it is difficult to find time for ourselves because people spend the most of there times working ,also each one has his own responsibilites this causes people to get in pressure and to forget about having fun .older people have more time than the youngest ones, they spend there time relaxing and free from the mentual pressure they worry less about their kids who by this time get setteld, which give them time to enjoy setting in their houses in silence , drinking coffe ,metting friends and spending time with their family and grand children there is a lot of activites for them to do for instant traviling ,reading books , playing golf and watching movies all this things gives happines and make life much prettier,however youngest people may find this activites boring , the value of enjoyment vary from age to age but it does not mean that there are people who enjoyy life more than others , it is depend on the person himself , sometimes we find older people full of energey , happiness and postivity more than teenagers whoes life supposed to be easier for them because when we get older our commitment gets bigger . yongest people enjoy invisting in life and going through adventures ,they enjoy dancing at the clubs , drinking, go shopping ,traviling. however they have mental pressure of work .ressponsibilites with family which encirceld them with all of these, they are not able to find time for themselves which results into frustration in life. they have fun but it does not last long , they need to deal with alot of responsibilites which causes them to feel tedious in their life.the percentage of dipression today found to be high in percentage in the youngesters than in old people the older ones on the other hand are seeing cherishing life and guding the youngesters to be cheerful.
