a teacher's ability to relate well with studentes is not more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being tought ,teachers have to do their job perfectly ,on one hand they need to know how to conact with the students and respect them,belive in them and their abilites ,however on other hand they need to recive the requied material to the studentes, thats why they are called teachers ,they are teachers and thier job is to teach .
teachers are supposed to share their knowledge with the students and guide them ,support them by giving them diffrent methodes in how to use the material and deal with it ,learn them new ways to use their skills and to show their abilites, beeing a good teacher who cares for her students and want to invest in them and to cuse them succes in their lives its not enough in order to become an briliant teacher who wants to get out the best of her students and wants to reach the top should do her job first if all so she will feel comfertable because she did her maximum , then its depends on the students themselves ,how they are going to use it and study it , the teacher's job is to define thier streangth and weakness if she gave them messing material its will be her false that some of the students failed then she cant judge them and devied the class in to sectiones by levels ,also she will start blaming herself for not giving her best , but when she is confident ,when she is sastified of her self and her job she can do that simply thats why,teachers should do both ,everything in life causes spesific result to aquaier intellegance in our education system we should focus on this points.
